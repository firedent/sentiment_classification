# Sentiment Classification
This project will built a sentiment classification CNN and LSTM for classificate the comment of IMBD following the network structure provided in the instruction. The early accuracy will be between 78% and 82%. The accuracy should be improved by optimization such as changing network structure, preprocess the data and adjust the hyperparameter. There is no NLP in this project.

`convert.py` is provided for converting the model producted from GPU to the model suitable for running with CPU. The final accuracy in submission system is 90%
